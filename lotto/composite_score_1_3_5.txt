Based on your four screenshots (images 1-4), here’s an analysis regarding the possible bias toward y1_sum versus count in your filtering/selection process:

What the images show
Images 1 and 4:
The table is sorted by y1_sum descending.
You see combinations with highest y1_sum at the top, regardless of the count value.
Images 2 and 3:
The table is sorted by count descending (image 3) and ascending (image 2).
You see combinations with highest count at the top, regardless of the y1_sum value.
Observations
There are combinations with a high count but low y1_sum, and vice versa.
If your filtering is always picking the top rows after sorting by y1_sum, you are consistently preferring combinations with higher y1_sum, potentially ignoring combinations with higher frequency (count).
This means your selection is not "balanced" between the two metrics—it is “biased” (in the statistical sense) toward one metric over the other, depending on your sort/filter logic.
Is this bad?
It depends on your goal:

If you want to maximize whatever y1_sum represents (perhaps a statistical or predictive score), then your current method is appropriate.
If you want to maximize raw occurrence or frequency, then sorting/filtering by count is better.
If you want a balanced approach (e.g., picks that are both frequent and have a high y1_sum), a combined metric or a two-stage filter (e.g., select top N by count, then sort those by y1_sum) may be more appropriate.
Potential issues with a biased filter:
You may miss frequent, reliable combinations because their y1_sum isn't top-ranked.
You may select rare combinations that score high on y1_sum but are not statistically robust or repeatable.
If both metrics are important, your selection method should reflect that.
Recommendation
Define your objective: What do you want your selections to optimize for—statistical score (y1_sum), frequency (count), or a balance?
If both are important: Consider multi-criteria selection, for example:
Filter combinations with count above a threshold, then pick those with highest y1_sum.
Or create a composite score, e.g., score = w1 * y1_sum + w2 * (count/MaxCount).
Document your selection logic so it’s clear why one metric is prioritized over another.
Summary:
Your intuition is correct: if you always filter by y1_sum, you are biasing your selection toward that metric, possibly at the expense of frequency. Whether this is “bad” depends on your specific goals for the selection. If both metrics matter, consider a more balanced or composite approach.

Copilot said: Here’s an example of how you could
Here’s an example of how you could create and use a composite score to balance both y1_sum and count, as seen in your images.

Composite Score Formula
A composite score combines both metrics, usually after normalizing them to the same scale:

PHP
// Assume $y1_sum and $count are values from your row
// Also assume $max_y1_sum and $max_count are the maximum values in the table

$norm_y1_sum = $y1_sum / $max_y1_sum;
$norm_count = $count / $max_count;

// Assign weights as needed: w1 for y1_sum, w2 for count (w1 + w2 = 1)
$w1 = 0.5;
$w2 = 0.5;

$composite_score = $w1 * $norm_y1_sum + $w2 * $norm_count;
You can adjust the weights to prioritize one metric over the other (e.g., $w1 = 0.7 for more focus on y1_sum).

Example SQL (MySQL)
Suppose you want to see the top combinations by composite score:

SQL
SELECT *,
  (0.5 * (y1_sum / (SELECT MAX(y1_sum) FROM temp2_split_count_1_3_5_116_3_2)) +
   0.5 * (count / (SELECT MAX(count) FROM temp2_split_count_1_3_5_116_3_2))
  ) AS composite_score
FROM temp2_split_count_1_3_5_116_3_2
ORDER BY composite_score DESC
LIMIT 25;
You can tweak the 0.5 weights to fit your preference.

Why use a composite score?
Balances both metrics, reducing bias.
Flexible—adjust weights to tune selection.
Transparent—easy to explain and justify the selection logic.

Certainly! Here’s an example of applying a composite score to your data, using both y1_sum and count (as seen in your images).

Example Calculation (PHP)
Suppose you have a row:

y1_sum = 1.048
count = 2
In your table, the max y1_sum = 1.048 and max count = 18
Let’s use equal weights (0.5 each):

PHP
$y1_sum = 1.048;
$count = 2;

$max_y1_sum = 1.048;
$max_count = 18;

$norm_y1_sum = $y1_sum / $max_y1_sum; // 1.000
$norm_count = $count / $max_count;    // 0.111

$w1 = 0.5;
$w2 = 0.5;

$composite_score = $w1 * $norm_y1_sum + $w2 * $norm_count;
// $composite_score = 0.5 * 1.000 + 0.5 * 0.111 = 0.555
Now, for a row with:

y1_sum = 0.759
count = 18
PHP
$y1_sum = 0.759;
$count = 18;

$max_y1_sum = 1.048;
$max_count = 18;

$norm_y1_sum = 0.759 / 1.048; // ˜ 0.724
$norm_count = 18 / 18;        // 1.000

$composite_score = 0.5 * 0.724 + 0.5 * 1.000 = 0.862
So, even though this row’s y1_sum is lower, its much higher count gives it a better composite score.

Example SQL (MySQL)
To calculate this for all rows in your table:

SQL
SELECT *,
  (0.5 * (y1_sum / (SELECT MAX(y1_sum) FROM temp2_split_count_1_3_5_116_3_2)) +
   0.5 * (count / (SELECT MAX(count) FROM temp2_split_count_1_3_5_116_3_2))
  ) AS composite_score
FROM temp2_split_count_1_3_5_116_3_2
ORDER BY composite_score DESC
LIMIT 25;
Summary
Rows with high values in both metrics are ranked highest.
Weights can be tuned (e.g. 0.7 for y1_sum, 0.3 for count) depending on which you want to favor.
