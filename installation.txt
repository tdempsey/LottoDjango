Files Created:

lot_display.py: Standalone script for generating predictions
app.py: Flask web application that offers a user-friendly interface
Templates: HTML templates for the web interface

Installation Instructions:

Install Required Dependencies:
pip install flask pandas numpy

Create Directory Structure:
Create the following directories in your project folder:
mkdir -p data static templates

Run the Application:
Option 1: Standalone Script
python lot_display.py
This will generate predictions and save them to a CSV file in the data directory.
Option 2: Web Application
python app.py
Then open your browser and navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Using the Web Application:
The web application provides four main functions:

Home Page: Overview of the application
View Draws: See past lottery draws with filtering options
Add Draw: Record new lottery draw results
Generate Predictions: Create new number predictions based on parameters

The system will create sample data on first run, which you can replace with actual Georgia Fantasy 5 data over time.
About the Solution:
This implementation follows the same pattern-based prediction logic shown in your original file. It:

Uses historical draws to identify patterns
Matches patterns based on sum and even/odd distribution
Fills middle numbers algorithmically
Provides customizable parameters for prediction generation

The error you encountered was likely due to trying to access data that didn't exist. The updated code includes robust error handling and better initialization to prevent these issues.
