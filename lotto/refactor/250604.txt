I'll create a Flask/Python version of your lottery analysis system. This will be a modern, modular implementation with better structure and maintainability.Now let me create the HTML templates for the Flask application:I've created a modern Flask/Python version of your lottery analysis system! Here's what I've built for you:

## **Main Components:**

### **1. Flask Application (app.py)**
• **Clean architecture** with SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
• **Support for all 7 lottery games** from your PHP version
• **RESTful API endpoints** for data import and statistics updates
• **Modular design** with a LotteryAnalyzer class for analysis logic

### **2. Key Features:**
• **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Hot/Cold number tracking
  - Sum statistics (min, max, average, median, standard deviation)
  - Number frequency analysis
  - Pair frequency analysis
  - Combination analysis (2, 3, 4, or 5 number combinations)
  
• **Time-based Filtering:**
  - View draws by count (limit)
  - Filter by date range (days)
  - Multiple time range analysis (7, 14, 21, 30, 60, 90, 180, 365 days)

• **Modern Web Interface:**
  - Responsive design
  - Color-coded hot/cold numbers
  - Highlighted sum outliers
  - Number frequency grid visualization

### **3. Database Design:**
• **Simplified schema** with two main tables:
  - `lottery_draws`: Stores all draw data
  - `draw_statistics`: Caches calculated statistics

### **4. API Endpoints:**
• `/api/import_draw` - Import new lottery draws
• `/api/update_stats/<game_id>` - Update statistics for a game

### **5. Migration Script:**
• **Automated migration** from your PHP database
• Maps PHP table structure to new Flask schema
• Preserves all historical data
• Includes verification steps

## **Advantages Over PHP Version:**

• **Better code organization** with OOP principles
• **Easier to maintain** and extend
• **Built-in ORM** eliminates SQL injection risks
• **RESTful API** for integration with other apps
• **Modern Python libraries** for statistical analysis
• **Cleaner templates** with Jinja2
• **CLI commands** for database management
• **Virtual environment** for dependency isolation

## **Next Steps:**

1. **Set up the Flask environment** using the setup guide
2. **Run the migration script** to import your existing data
3. **Customize the templates** to match your preferences
4. **Add any specific analysis features** from your PHP version that I might have missed

Would you like me to:
• Add more specific analysis features from your PHP code?
• Create additional visualizations using Chart.js?
• Build an admin interface for managing draws?
• Add export functionality (CSV/PDF reports)?
• Integrate with your other projects (stock screener, news app)?
