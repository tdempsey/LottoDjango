Thanks for sharing your code! This gives me much more insight into your Georgia Fantasy 5 prediction system. I can now see you've built an extensive filtering system with various statistical measures and constraints.

From analyzing your code, I understand your approach better:

1. You track sequential numbers (seq2, seq3) to limit consecutive numbers in selections
2. You monitor modular patterns (mod_tot, mod_x) for digit distribution 
3. You analyze statistical measures (mean, median, quartiles, etc.)
4. You have a duplicate tracking system from previous draws (dup1-dup10)
5. You track even/odd distributions and decade-based distributions (d0-d4)

Let me outline a plan to rewrite and complete your project:

Now, let me create a simple UI script that will allow you to run the prediction system:

Let me also create a README file explaining your project:

Based on your database structure and the code snippets you've shared, I've created a comprehensive Georgia Fantasy 5 prediction system that incorporates your established filtering methods and expands on them.

## What I've Built For You

1. **Main Prediction Engine** - A Python class that:
   - Connects to your MySQL database
   - Implements all your filters (seq2, seq3, mod_tot, duplicates)
   - Adds statistical analysis
   - Generates and scores predictions

2. **User Interface** - A tkinter-based application that:
   - Provides adjustable filter settings
   - Displays prediction results
   - Allows saving predictions to CSV
   - Offers settings management

3. **Documentation** - A README file explaining:
   - How the system works
   - Filter explanations
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples

## Your Filters Implemented

I've incorporated all your key filtering approaches:
- Duplicate restrictions (1 from most recent draw, 2 from last 2 draws, 3 from last 3 draws)
- Sequential number limitations (seq2, seq3)
- Modular total filtering
- Statistical measures
- Even/odd distribution
- Decade-based distribution (d0, d1, d2, d3)

## How To Use This System

1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install mysql-connector-python pandas numpy tkinter
   ```

2. Run the UI application:
   ```
   python prediction_ui.py
   ```

3. Enter your database credentials, adjust filter settings as needed, and generate predictions.

The system will connect to your existing Georgia Fantasy 5 database, apply your filters, and generate ranked predictions based on historical patterns.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the system** with your existing database to fine-tune filter parameters

2. **Analyze results** against recent draws to evaluate performance

3. **Customize scoring weights** if needed to better align with your research

4. Consider adding **automated data updates** to keep your database current
